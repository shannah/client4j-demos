    <description><![CDATA[ 
The Kitchen Sink demo is the first Codename One demo ever made. It recently went thru a complete rewrite to modernize it and improve it's UX/UI and functionality.
The demo displays icons/cards with various categories to show off various features of Codename One such as layouts, theming, animations/effects etc. Notice that the demo adapts itself to the form factor and acts differently when running on a Tablet than it would on a phone.
